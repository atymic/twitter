## Installation

```
composer require thujohn/twitter
```

## Configuration 

Just set the below environment variables in your `.env`. 

```
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=
```

### Advanced configuration

Run `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Thujohn\Twitter\TwitterServiceProvider"`
```
/config/ttwitter.php
```

# Roadmap

### 2.x 

2.x is in maintenance mode, so we'll continue to add support for new versions, bug fixes, etc but won't be adding new features.
We'll keep the original package namespace & not break backward compatibility. 

### 3.x 

3.x will be a new major version and will not be backward compatible with 2.x
The main goals of 3.x are

- Removing our dependency on `tmhoauth` which is extremely outdated
- Switching to PSR based modules where possible (PSR7 for requests, PSR3 for logging, etc)
- Take advantage of the newer PHP language features such as typing to make the package more robust
- Decouple the package from Laravel, as there isn't that much logic specific to the framework and it would be good to
be able to use it in other frameworks.

We'll release a detailed migration guide to make switching as easy as possible.

# Usage

## Output format

You can choose between three different output formats. By default responses will be returned as objects. To change this,
use the `format` option in the parameters you pass to any method. 

```
format : object|json|array (default:object)
```

## Helper Functions

Get Last Response: Get the last response from twitter. For example, you can access the headers to check your rate limit quota.
```php
$res = Twitter::getLastResponse();
var_dump($res['headers']); // ['Rate-Limit' => 'Whatever']
```

Linkify : Transforms URLs, @usernames, hashtags into links.
The type of $tweet can be object, array or text.
By sending an object or an array the method will expand links (t.co) too.
```php
Twitter::linkify($tweet);
```

Ago : Converts date into difference (2 hours ago)
```php
Twitter::ago($timestamp);
```

LinkUser : Generates a link to a specific user, by their user object (such as $tweet->user), or id/string.
```php
Twitter::linkUser($user);
```

LinkTweet : Generates a link to a specific tweet.
```php
Twitter::linkTweet($tweet);
```


## Examples

Returns a collection of the most recent Tweets posted by the user indicated by the screen_name or user_id parameters.
```php
Route::get('/userTimeline', function()
{
	return Twitter::getUserTimeline(['screen_name' => 'thujohn', 'count' => 20, 'format' => 'json']);
});
```

Returns a collection of the most recent Tweets and retweets posted by the authenticating user and the users they follow.
```php
Route::get('/homeTimeline', function()
{
	return Twitter::getHomeTimeline(['count' => 20, 'format' => 'json']);
});
```

Returns the X most recent mentions (tweets containing a users's @screen_name) for the authenticating user.
```php
Route::get('/mentionsTimeline', function()
{
	return Twitter::getMentionsTimeline(['count' => 20, 'format' => 'json']);
});
```

Updates the authenticating user's current status, also known as tweeting.
```php
Route::get('/tweet', function()
{
	return Twitter::postTweet(['status' => 'Laravel is beautiful', 'format' => 'json']);
});
```

Updates the authenticating user's current status with media.
```php
Route::get('/tweetMedia', function()
{
	$uploaded_media = Twitter::uploadMedia(['media' => File::get(public_path('filename.jpg'))]);
	return Twitter::postTweet(['status' => 'Laravel is beautiful', 'media_ids' => $uploaded_media->media_id_string]);
});
```

Get User Credentials with email.
```php
$credentials = Twitter::getCredentials([
    'include_email' => 'true',
]);
```
> In the above, you need to pass true as a string, not as a boolean. The boolean will get converted to `1` which Twitter ignores.

> This also is assuming you have your permissions setup correctly with Twitter. You have to choose 'Get user email' when you set up your Twitter app, passing the value alone will not be enough.


Sign in with twitter
```php
Route::get('twitter/login', ['as' => 'twitter.login', function(){
	// your SIGN IN WITH TWITTER  button should point to this route
	$sign_in_twitter = true;
	$force_login = false;

	// Make sure we make this request w/o tokens, overwrite the default values in case of login.
	Twitter::reconfig(['token' => '', 'secret' => '']);
	$token = Twitter::getRequestToken(route('twitter.callback'));

	if (isset($token['oauth_token_secret']))
	{
		$url = Twitter::getAuthorizeURL($token, $sign_in_twitter, $force_login);

		Session::put('oauth_state', 'start');
		Session::put('oauth_request_token', $token['oauth_token']);
		Session::put('oauth_request_token_secret', $token['oauth_token_secret']);

		return Redirect::to($url);
	}

	return Redirect::route('twitter.error');
}]);

Route::get('twitter/callback', ['as' => 'twitter.callback', function() {
	// You should set this route on your Twitter Application settings as the callback
	// https://apps.twitter.com/app/YOUR-APP-ID/settings
	if (Session::has('oauth_request_token'))
	{
		$request_token = [
			'token'  => Session::get('oauth_request_token'),
			'secret' => Session::get('oauth_request_token_secret'),
		];

		Twitter::reconfig($request_token);

		$oauth_verifier = false;

		if (Input::has('oauth_verifier'))
		{
			$oauth_verifier = Input::get('oauth_verifier');
			// getAccessToken() will reset the token for you
			$token = Twitter::getAccessToken($oauth_verifier);
		}

		if (!isset($token['oauth_token_secret']))
		{
			return Redirect::route('twitter.error')->with('flash_error', 'We could not log you in on Twitter.');
		}

		$credentials = Twitter::getCredentials();

		if (is_object($credentials) && !isset($credentials->error))
		{
			// $credentials contains the Twitter user object with all the info about the user.
			// Add here your own user logic, store profiles, create new users on your tables...you name it!
			// Typically you'll want to store at least, user id, name and access tokens
			// if you want to be able to call the API on behalf of your users.

			// This is also the moment to log in your users if you're using Laravel's Auth class
			// Auth::login($user) should do the trick.

			Session::put('access_token', $token);

			return Redirect::to('/')->with('flash_notice', 'Congrats! You\'ve successfully signed in!');
		}

		return Redirect::route('twitter.error')->with('flash_error', 'Crab! Something went wrong while signing you up!');
	}
}]);

Route::get('twitter/error', ['as' => 'twitter.error', function(){
	// Something went wrong, add your own error handling here
}]);

Route::get('twitter/logout', ['as' => 'twitter.logout', function(){
	Session::forget('access_token');
	return Redirect::to('/')->with('flash_notice', 'You\'ve successfully logged out!');
}]);
```

Webhook
>In order to setup webhook successfully, you'll need to return a hash using the CRC token in response from your webhook URL ([more info](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/accounts-and-users/subscribe-account-activity/guides/securing-webhooks)).
```php
Route::post('twitter/webhook', ['as' => 'twitter.webhook', function(){
	if (request()->has('crc_token'))
		return response()->json(['response_token' => Twitter::crcHash(request()->crc_token)], 200);
	
	// Your webhook logic goes here
}]);
```

## Debug

First activate debug in the config file.

Then you can access the logs() method.

```php
try
{
	$response = Twitter::getUserTimeline(['count' => 20, 'format' => 'array']);
}
catch (Exception $e)
{
	// dd(Twitter::error());
	dd(Twitter::logs());
}

dd($response);
```
